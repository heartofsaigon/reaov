#' Species diversity on the Galapagos Islands
#'
#' Report the number of species found on the various Gal√°pagos Islands
#'
#' @format
#' There are 30 Galapagos islands and 6 variables in the dataset.
#' The relationship between the number of plant species and several
#' geographic variables is of interest. The original dataset contained
#' several missing values which have been filled for convenience.
